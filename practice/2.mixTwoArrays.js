/*
 Evenly mix two arrays
  Write a function that receives two arrays, then mix the two arrays evenly â€“starting with the first item of the first array. The returned array should alternate between each array in turn, one element at a time. So the sequence would look like:
  Array 1 first element, Array 2 first element, Array 1 second element, Array 2 second element... and so on.
  The elements that make up the arrays are completely random, and the arrays can be of differing lengths.
  const mix = (firstArray, secondArray) => { // your code
  }
  console.log(mix([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]))
  // [1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 6]
  console.log(mix(["h", "a", "c"], [7, 4, 17, 10, 48])) // ["h", 7, "a", 4, "c", 17, 10, 48]
*/

function mix(arr, arr2) {
  let result = [];
  let currentArray = arr.length <= arr2.length ? arr : arr2;
  let currentIndex = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < currentArray.length; i++) {
    result.push(arr[i], arr2[i]);
    currentIndex++;
  };
  return result.concat(arr.slice(currentIndex), arr2.slice(currentIndex));
}

mix([1, 2], [3, 4, 5]);
